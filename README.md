Project designed to watch videos and chat together with your friends.

The app supports creation of accounts, along with attachable profile pictures. Your username in chat is identified by the email you signed up with.

This app runs with firebase. You can attach your own firebase instance by editing the config parameters found in firebase.js.
Current known bugs:
- Video size is unadjustable
- Stutter may occur when more than one player is syncing up, as the players will wait until players have been buffered.
